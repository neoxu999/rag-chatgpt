Retrieval Augmented Generation Lab with ChatGPT
This is a simple lab I have implemented to test Knowledge Augmented or Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models. In particular, I am using LangChain, Streamlit, and OpenAI ChatGPT API. This project has been an excuse to try RAG and LangChain.

Run it with:

streamlit run chat.py
Disclaimer: This is a personal project without any guarantee and I am not planning to maintain it.

Requirements
I have fixed the requirements with the versions I have used during the development. But the code will probably work with previous and newer versions.

Install the requirements with

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
You will also need to create a .env file with the content:

OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR OPENAI API KEY"
Example
After running the streamlit app with

streamlit run chat.py
